I am a data scientist with special interest in responsible AI, and monitoring and explainability
of machine learning systems.
In recent years, I have been working on developing tools and measures for issues
surrounding fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML.

I have received a PhD in computer science from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/).
My PhD advisors was Professor [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/).
During my PhD, I spent some time at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems
as a research visitor and worked with Professor [Krishna P. Gummadi](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/)
who was my PhD co-advisor.
Before joining BU, I received a M.Sc. in computer science from [University of Bonn](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en)
and I worked at as a reasearch assistant.

I am interested in the applications of machine learning in healthcare, finance, and systems biology.
In the past, I have worked on developing novel data-driven approaches for
recommender systems and the analysis of genomics (Single-cell RNA) data.
