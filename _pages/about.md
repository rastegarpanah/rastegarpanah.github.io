I am a data scientist with special interest in machilne learning monitoring and responsible AI.
In recent years, I have been working on developing tools and measures for issues
surrounding fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML.

I have received a PhD in computer science from Boston University.
My PhD advisors were Mark Crovella and Krishna Gummadi.
Before joining BU I received a M.Sc. in computer science from Univeristy of Bonn.

In the past, I have worked on developing novel data-driven solutions for
recommender systems and systems biology (Single-cell RNA) problems.
