I am a data scientist with special interest in responsible AI, and monitoring and explainability
of machine learning systems.
In recent years, I have been working on developing tools and measures for issues
surrounding fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML.

I have received a PhD in computer science from Boston University.
My PhD advisors were Mark Crovella and Krishna Gummadi.
Before joining BU I received a M.Sc. in computer science from University of Bonn.

I am interested in the applications of machine learning in healthcare, finance, and systems biology.
In the past, I have worked on developing novel data-driven approaches for
recommender systems and the analysis of genomics (Single-cell RNA) data.
