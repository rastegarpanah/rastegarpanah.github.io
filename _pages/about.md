I am a data scientist passionate about monitoring and explainability of machine learning systems.
In recent years, I have been working on developing tools and measures for issues surrounding
fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML.

I am broadly interested in finding robust and trustworthy data-driven solutions
to problems in healthcare, finance, social sciences, and systems biology.
I have previously worked on developing novel computational approaches for recommender systems
and for the analysis of genomics (Single-cell RNA) data.

I received a PhD in computer science from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/)
where my advisor was Professor [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/).
During my PhD, I was also a research visitor at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) 
where I worked with Professor [Krishna P. Gummadi](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/).
Before that, I received a M.Sc. in computer science from [University of Bonn](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en) and
a B.Sc. in software engineering from Univeristy of Isfahan.
