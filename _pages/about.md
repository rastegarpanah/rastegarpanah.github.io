I am a data scientist passionate about monitoring and explainability of machine learning systems.
In recent years, I have been working on developing tools and measures for issues surrounding
fairness, privacy, and explainability in ML.
I am broadly interested in building robust and trustworthy machine learning systems 
with applications in healthcare, finance, social sciences, and systems biology.
I have worked on developing novel data-driven computational approaches for recommender systems
and the analysis of genomics (Single-cell RNA) data.

I received a PhD in computer science from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/)
where my advisor was Professor [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/).
At the same time, I was a research visitor at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) 
where I worked with Professor [Krishna P. Gummadi](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/).
Before that, I received a M.Sc. in computer science from [University of Bonn](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en),
and I was a research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html).
